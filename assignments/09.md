## Lesson 9 Assignment

### Implement a form for updating a trimester
Updating a resource is similar to creating a new resource -- we need to a route and view display the update form, and we need a route to handle the form submission. In the [Rails Guides CRUD, Verbs and Actions table](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#crud-verbs-and-actions), we see a row for "return an HTML form for editing" and a row for "update a specific <resource>". You have the information you need in this table to set up the routes to display the edit form and to update a trimester on form submission.

1. Follow the steps we've been following in lesssons to create the route and view you need to display the form.
2. Write a request spec for the edit route that expects the application deadline label to be present in the response body. Be sure your test passes.
3. Follow the steps to create a route to update a trimester with a new application deadline. The edit form data should be sent as data in a PUT request to that route.
4. Write a request spec with the following tests (and ensure your code passes them):
    - When a PUT request is made with an application deadline that is a valid date, and a trimester exists for the trimester id included in the request, a trimester's application deadline is updated as expected (per request data)
    - When a PUT request is made without an application deadline, the test expects the response status to be 400 (or `:bad_request`). 
    - When a PUT request is made and the application deadline is not a valid date, the test expects the response status to be 400 (or `:bad_request`). 
    - When a PUT request is made to a route with a trimester id that does not belong to an existing trimester, the test expects the response status to be 404 (or `:not_found`)
