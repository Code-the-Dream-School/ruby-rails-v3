## Lesson 6 Assignment

1. Create a route, controller and action, and view to display a list of mentors and write request specs that test the route
2. Create a route, controller and action, and view to display a single mentor and write request specs that test the route

Both of these routes can be defined as "resourceful routes". Use the [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#resource-routing-the-rails-default) to help you follow the steps to define the route and views. Be sure to follow Rails conventions.

1. Define the route, and map the route to a controller and action
2. Respond to the request with HTML (you can outline with static or fake data at first)
3. Collect the data to display and include it in the HTML reponse
