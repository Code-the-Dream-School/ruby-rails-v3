## Lesson 3 Assignment
### Question 1
Now that we have the ability to manage assignments and reviews within our application, let's add existing data about assignments to our new table. In this file `db/load_assignment_data.rb`, you'll see an array of assignment data to be added to the assignments table. Below the array, write some code that loops through the array and creates an assignment record for each element with the appropriate attributes. You can test your code in Rails console as you're figuring out the syntax and structure. When you're ready to run your code, from a terminal prompt (not in rails console), call the ruby executable and pass the filename:

```
ruby db/load_assignment_data.rb
```

### Question 2
Now that we have a place to store assignment submissions and reviews, we should enable mentors to log in and add reviews themselves. Now that we'll have users other than Dream of Code staff using the application, we should add the ability for users to log in, so that we can permit access only to what each user should be able to access. We'll add that functionality later, but for now, let's add a table to hold user data.

Create a table and model called `users` (and `User`, respectively)  with the following columns:
- email (string, not nullable)
- role (string, not nullable)
- password (string, not nullable)
- password_digest (string, not nullable)

After you run the migration, open the Rails console and create a user to test your code.

### Question 3
Answer this question in a markdown file called `lesson_03_question_3.md` and add it to your doc-rails repository.

Suppose we want to store our music collection in a relational database. 

Assume the following:
- We want to store artists, albums, songs and media type (vinyl, CD, cassette, mp3)
- Every album has an artist
- Every song belongs to an album

Create an ERD to represent how you would store the data. No need to use an ERD creation tool. A simple sketch will work, or you can even do this in text if you prefer, just be sure to include foreign keys where appropriate.

Then outline the models for each entity in your diagram and include all ActiveRecord associations (`has_many`, `belongs_to`, etc) for each.
