# Lesson 12 Assignment

## Add user accounts and authentication to your project
Add Devise to your project and determine what routes need to be protected by authentication. What routes need to be publicly accessible? Design a solution prohibits access to routes from unauthenticated users where appropriate. For each route that requires authentication, add a test to your request specs that expects a 404 (not found) or 403 (forbidden) response when the route receieves a request from an unauthenticated user.

TODO: Consider if this should just be the assignment for week 11
