## Lesson 2 Assignment 
### Question 1
Now on your own, create a new Coding Class. It can be anything you want. Then creating a new course -- an instance of your coding class in a trimester. You'll use `Course.create` and pass a hash of attributes that include `trimester_id` and `coding_class_id` as keys, and as values -- the id's of a trimester and your new coding class's id.

### model_instance.update
Suppose we decide to change the application deadline on the upcoming trimester to give students more time to apply. Let's update the trimester record using ActiveRecord (AR).

Recall from the video that classes have both attributes (including one for each column) and behaviors or methods. In the video, the Dog class has a `bark` method. All AR model instances have the ability to update the table row they represent using the method `update`. Similar to `create` and `find_by` (which are methods on the AR class, rather than on an instance), the `update` method takes as a parameter, a hash of attributes. We pass the attribute names (as symbols) as keys, and the new data are passed as values.
