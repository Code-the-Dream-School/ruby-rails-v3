## Lesson 2 Assignment 
### Question 1
- In the Rails console, create a new `CodingClass`. It can be on any topic you want (doesn't have to be a language or framework.)
- Then create a new course (an instance of your coding class) in a the upcoming trimester. You'll use `Course.create` and pass a hash of attributes that include `trimester_id` and `coding_class_id` as keys, and as values -- the id's of a trimester and your new coding class's id.
- Create a new student record and enroll the student in the course.
- Find a mentor with no more than 2 students (enrollments) assigned and assign that mentor to your new student's enrollment.

### Question 2
Let's begin designing the data model for your project! We'll need to start with a high level description of the application and what a user should be able to do in the app.

### Describe your project 
Write a description of your project idea. Try to answer the questions below in your description if they are applicable. 
- Who are the users of your application? Do you have different types of users or different roles?
- What are the core user scenarios or features of your app? These could be statements like... 
   - "A user can create book reviews"
   - "A user can add books to their bookshelf"
   - "A user can like view the book reviews of another user"
- Or if it makes more sense for your idea, you might describe some process or flow...for example:
   - "First, a meeting organizer creates a poll. Then they add meeting attendees, and the attendees vote on a time. Then after each has voted, the poll closes and a meeting is created."
- Consider sketching some wireframes for the main or more complex screens of your app. When you do this, think of what data you'll need to display on each page. 

### Design the data model
1. Start by just listing out what you think the "nouns" or tables (or models) will be in your application. What are the things you talk about when you describe the application?
   1. Refer back to your
2. Now think about the data each of these things will hold. Some of these may be attributes or columns, but be on the lookout for data that may be associations with other "nouns".
3. Create an ERD to visualize your tables and data.
    1. Don't worry too much about following ERD creation rules exactly. Just list table names and column names.
    2. **Do** try to follow Rails naming conventions here. If you figure this out now and note them in your ERD or your plan, it will be easier for you when creating your migrations and models.
    3. Do your best, but know that this is a starting point for collaboration between you and your mentors. When designing a data model on a software team, often more than one developer collaborate on the design together. You should plan to iterate on your design and expect feedback and input from your mentors.
