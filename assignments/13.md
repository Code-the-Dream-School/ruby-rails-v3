## Lesson 13 Assignment

### Design and implement an API route that returns mentor data

Design and implement an API route that meets the following requirements:

Given a course id, the route returns all mentors assigned to students in that course. Mentor data should include id, email, name and their list of students. For each student, include the student's id, name and email.

Add a request spec that includes tests that expect the response data to include the above items. What edge cases should we consider testing regarding mentor data? Write tests for those scenarios as well.
