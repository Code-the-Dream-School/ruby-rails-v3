## Lesson 13 Assignment

### Finish `GET /api/v1/courses/:course_id/enrollments`
Continue with the steps we've outlined: 
- Respond with static data
- Then respond with dynamic data

When collecting the data to respond. Use these steps to guide you:
- Get the courses for the current trimester
- For each of the courses in the current trimester, loop through the enrollments and create a hash of data as outlined in the example data in the lesson.
- Add each of the hash elements to the `enrollments` key of the main hash and pass it to `respond_to`.
- Remove the `skip: true` attribute and run the spec in `spec/requests/api/v1/enrollments_controller_spec.rb` to test your code.
