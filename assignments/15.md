## Lesson 15 Assignment

## What else does your project need?
It's possible your application requires some additional functionality that we didn't quite cover in this course. Or maybe you have some bugs to troubleshoot. Use this week to add any missing necessary functionality or clean up any unwanted behavior in your app. Try to use primary sources first (like Rails Guides, gem docs, Ruby docs) before internet searches or seeking assistance from AI. If you do get help (from AI, mentors, classmates, anywhere), try to take some time to understand what you're adding to your code or project. Ask questions if you don't understand. It's less important that your app is impressive...it's more important that you understand what your code does!

When you're done, double check your app against the rubric one last time and submit for a final assessment.

Congratulations on completing this course! Really hope you enjoyed it!
