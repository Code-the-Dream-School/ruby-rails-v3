## Lesson 4 Assignment
### Describe your project 
Write a description of your project idea. Try to answer the questions below in your description if they are applicable. 
- Who are the users of your application? Do you have different types of users or different roles?
- What are the core user scenarios or features of your app? These could be statements like... 
   - "A user can create book reviews"
   - "A user can add books to their bookshelf"
   - "A user can like view the book reviews of another user"
- Or if it makes more sense for your idea, you might describe some process or flow...for example:
   - "First, a meeting organizer creates a poll. Then they add meeting attendees, and the attendees vote on a time. Then after each has voted, the poll closes and a meeting is created."
- Consider sketching some wireframes for the main or more complex screens of your app. When you do this, think of what data you'll need to display on each page. 

### Design the data model
1. Start by just listing out what you think the "nouns" or tables (or models) will be in your application. What are the things you talk about when you describe the application?
   1. Refer back to your
2. Now think about the data each of these things will hold. Some of these may be attributes or columns, but be on the lookout for data that may be associations with other "nouns".
3. Create an ERD to visualize your tables and data.
    1. Don't worry too much about following ERD creation rules exactly. Just list table names and column names.
    2. Do worry about following Rails naming conventions here. If you figure this out now and note them in your ERD or your plan, it will be easier for you when creating your migrations and models.

### Create migrations and models
When you're ready to create your tables and models, create them one at a time and check the outcome after each migration run.

It's important that you create dependent models first. That is, if you have a model that "belongs to" a different model, you will need to create the "parent" model and table first.
1. Generate your migration and model:
   ```
   bundle exec rails generate ...
   ```
2. Run the migration to create the database table and update `db/schema.rb`
   ```
   bundle exec rails db:migrate
   ```
   Watch for errors and don't move on if you have errors. Read the error and try to fix the migration. (This is a time when it may be okay to ask ChatGPT for help if you can't figure it out. But be sure to read the explanation and try to understand the fix.)
3. Repeat the steps above with the next model.


### A tip about many-to-many relationships
If you find yourself wanting to store multiple items in one column or attribute, it's likely that you'll be better served with another table and an association. 

For example, suppose we want to store which trimesters a mentor has agreed to volunteer for. It might sound reasonable to add a column to the `mentors` table called `assigned_trimesters`, which would hold an array of trimester id's. However, if we want to take advantage of ActiveRecord's `has_many` association (which would allow something like `mentor.trimesters`), we'll want to add a "join" or "association" table that holds the relationship between mentors and trimesters. We might call it `mentor_trimester_assignments`, and it would have columns `mentor_id` and `trimester_id`.

### Assignment submission
Your assignment this week will be a new Github repo with your migrations and models. Keep your ERD for reference and to discuss with your mentor.

### Friendly tip
Remember the advice from the developer in the video from the intro lesson...you learn when you fail, not when you succeed. This is a very friendly place to fail as there are no negative consequences from a "needs revisions" review!
