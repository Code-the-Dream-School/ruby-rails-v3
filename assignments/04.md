## Lesson 4 Assignment
At this point, hopefully you've received feedback on your plan for your data model from week 2. This week, you'll use what you learned about generating migrations and creating models to create migrations, tables and models for your own project.

### Create migrations and models
When you're ready to create your migrations, tables and models, create them one at a time and check the outcome after each migration run.

It's important that you create dependent models first. That is, if you have a model that "belongs to" a different model, you will need to create the "parent" model and table first.
1. Generate your migration and model:
   ```
   bundle exec rails generate ...
   ```
2. Run the migration to create the database table and update `db/schema.rb`
   ```
   bundle exec rails db:migrate
   ```
   Watch for errors and don't move on if you have errors. Read the error and try to fix the migration. (This is a time when it may be okay to ask ChatGPT for help if you can't figure it out. But be sure to read the explanation and try to understand the fix.)
3. Repeat the steps above with the next model.


### A tip about many-to-many relationships
If you find yourself wanting to store multiple items in one column or attribute, it's likely that you'll be better served with another table and an association. 

For example, suppose we want to store which trimesters a mentor has agreed to volunteer for. It might sound reasonable to add a column to the `mentors` table called `assigned_trimesters`, which would hold an array of trimester id's. However, if we want to take advantage of ActiveRecord's `has_many` association (which would allow something like `mentor.trimesters`), we'll want to add a "join" or "association" table that holds the relationship between mentors and trimesters. We might call it `mentor_trimester_assignments`, and it would have columns `mentor_id` and `trimester_id`.

### Assignment submission
Your assignment this week will be a new Github repo with your migrations and models. Keep your ERD for reference and to discuss with your mentor.

### Friendly tip
Remember the advice from the developer in the video from the intro lesson...you learn when you fail, not when you succeed. This is a very friendly place to fail as there are no negative consequences from a "needs revisions" review!
