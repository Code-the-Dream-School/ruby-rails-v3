## Lesson 1 Assignment 
### Question 1
**Finish Task 1: Collect emails for students in the current Intro course**

During the lesson, we collected upcoming courses data. Now we need a list of emails for students currently enrolled in Intro to Programming:

- On the `enrollments` tab, we see that an enrollment has columns `student_id` and `course_id`.
- Find **any two** students enrolled in the Intro to Programming - Spring 2025 course and fill in the following template for each matching student row:

```
<student id>, <student email>
```

### Question 2
**Task 2: Email all mentors who have not assigned a final grade**

Our next task is to email all the mentors for students in the current **(Spring 2025) Intro to Programming** course who do not yet have a final grade (on the `enrollments` tab), so that we can remind them to finish grading. 

- Reference the following sheets: `mentor_enrollment_assignments`, `enrollments`, `courses`, `coding_classes`, `trimesters`, `mentors`,
- Find **any two** mentors who have not assigned a final grade for students in a Spring 2025 course. For each mentor, complete the following template:

```
<mentor id>, <mentor email>
```

  - Make note of the trimester's id
- Write an ActiveRecord query to find the `CodingClass` with the title above.
