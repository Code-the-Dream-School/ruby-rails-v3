## Lesson 1 Assignment 
### Question 1
Finish task 1 -- email students about upcoming courses

During the lesson, we collected upcoming courses data. Now we need a list of emails for students currently enrolled in Intro to Programming:
1. On the `enrollments` tab, we see that an enrollment has columns `student_id` and `course_id`.
2. Find the list of students enrolled in the Intro to Programming - Spring 2025 course and fill in the following template for each matching student row:

```
<student id>, <student email>
```

### Question 2
Task 2: Email all mentors who have not assigned a final grade
Our next task is to email all the mentors for students in the current (Spring 2025) Intro to Programming course who do not yet have a final grade (on the `enrollments` tab), so that we can remind them to finish grading. You'll want to reference the `mentor_enrollment_assignments` tab and the `mentors` tab in addition to the other tabs you've referenced above. For each mentor, complete the following template:

```
<mentor id>, <mentor email>
```


## Lesson 1 Assignment - Question 3 (TODO REVISIT)
Let's see how we can retrieve the data in Question 1 using ActiveRecord.

Try this in the rails console prompt:
```
CodingClass.find_by({ title: 'Intro to Programming' })
```

This is our first bit of Ruby, so let's take a minute to understand what we've written.
- `CodingClass` is a Ruby class
- `find_by` is a method on `CodingClass`, and we are calling the method with the dot operator. You likely learned to use the dot operator to access attributes and call methods in Javascript, so hopefully this syntax is familiar.
- `{ title: 'Intro to Programming' }` is a Ruby hash, and it's very similar to an object literal in Javascript. A Ruby hash is a collection of key, value pairs. There is one key called `title`, and the corresponding value is a string 'Intro to Programming'. In Javascript, keys are strings, while in Ruby, keys may be strings, but they may also be a Ruby datatype called a symbol. We may discuss symbols in more detail later, but for now, it's enough know that symbols are similar to strings, and they are frequently used as keys in a hash.

Let's continue gathering the data we need. We want to get the id of the upcoming trimester, so that we can use that id to find the courses scheduled in that trimester.

```
Trimester.find_by(year: '2025', term: 'Fall')
```

Now we have the data we need to get the list of Fall 2025 courses. See if you can figure out an ActiveRecord query that displays the list of `Course` records that belong to the coding class and trimester output from the above queries. Execute that query in the command prompt and check the output with your answer from Question 1. Include the ActiveRecord query as your answer to this question in your assignment.
