### Question 1
**Finish Task 1: Collect emails for students in the current Intro course**

During the lesson, we collected upcoming courses data. Now we need a list of emails for students currently enrolled in Intro to Programming:

- On the `enrollments` tab, we see that an enrollment has columns `student_id` and `course_id`.
- Find **any two** students enrolled in the Intro to Programming - Spring 2025 course and fill in the following template for each matching student row:

```
<student id>, <student email>
```

Now determine how to find this data using ActiveRecord queries and Ruby. Copy your commands here. You can take as many or few steps as you'd like.

### Question 2
**Task 2: Email all mentors who have not assigned a final grade**

Our next task is to email all the mentors for students in the current **(Spring 2025) Intro to Programming** course who do not yet have a final grade (on the `enrollments` tab), so that we can remind them to finish grading. 

- Reference the following sheets: `mentor_enrollment_assignments`, `enrollments`, `courses`, `coding_classes`, `trimesters`, `mentors`,
- Find **any two** mentors who have not assigned a final grade for students in a Spring 2025 course. For each mentor, complete the following template:

```
<mentor id>, <mentor email>
```

As a challenge, determine how to find this data using ActiveRecord queries and Ruby. Again, you can take as many steps as you'd like. Copy your commands below.

## Extra practice with Ruby
We'll spend a lot of time in the Rails console, which, as we mentioned, requires us to code in Ruby. [Try Ruby](https://try.ruby-lang.org/) is a great introductory resource for learning a bit about the language, and becoming more comfortable writing Ruby code. (It's also a creation of Why the Lucky Stiff, the Ruby artist mentioned in the intro of this course!) The lessons are short, interactive and in-browser, so you can practice without opening up the rails console or an irb console, which is the REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) for Ruby that Rails console uses.

You don't need to submit anything for this part, but spending some time learning Ruby now will make things easier for you for the rest of this course. You don't need to do all the lessons, and some of the early lessons may be a bit rudimentary for you since you have some programming experience. I recommend starting with the page titled "Of All the Summaries, #3 is Here Now" and continuing for as long as you'd like from there. Have fun! :)
