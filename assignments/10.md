## Lesson 10 Assignment

### Implement create and update routes in your project
Now you should be able to implement create and update functionality in your project. Start with your requirements or use case list. What do users need to create or edit? What resources are involved in each of these tasks? Sketch some wireframes for your forms if you haven't already. This can help you identify what data you need to display on your form (the GET route). What data should be created or updated when the form is submitted? Do you need to create or update multiple resources in one submission? Does it make sense for your route to be a resource route, or not?

Consider using rails generators to help scaffold controllers or views. Add request specs for the most important functionality. If you run low on time, focus your tests on the most important functionality. It's probably more important to test the outcome of a POST or PUT request than to test that the form contains a title, for example.
