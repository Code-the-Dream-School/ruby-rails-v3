## Controllers and routing - Reading and displaying data

Not all Dream of Code staff is comfortable working in the Rails console, so we'll need to build a frontend that enables staff to manage the school's operations.

Up to this point, we've focused most of our attention on ActiveRecord and the interactions between the database and how the data is modeled and manipulated within the application. Now we'll learn about the Rails web server, and how it receives and responds to HTTP requests.

You probably have an intuitive understanding of how the internet works, but it's important to understand the language of the web at a deeper level if you plan to develop web applications. Watch this video for a brief, but thorough overview.

At the core of web development is the web request/response cycle. Watch this video for a brief explainer and then we'll discuss how the Rails web server receives and responds to web requests.

This is a nice diagram that illustrates the web request/response cycle and how a Rails app handles receiving and fulfilling a request, then responding. We'll talk in more detail about each of these. You may want to refer back to this picture as we learn more.

## Displaying data on the frontend
**Task: To start, let's display a list of trimesters for school staff to view.**

Here's the steps we'll follow:
1. Define the route (url + HTTP method) that will display the data when the user visits it, and map the route to the code that will be executed when the request is received.
2. Respond to the request (at the route from step 1) with HTML
3. Collect the data we want to display and include that in our HTML reponse

We'll follow a (manual) test-driven approach and verify each step along the way.

### Step 1. Defining the route
Our task is to display a list of trimester records on the frontend. Consulting the [the Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#crud-verbs-and-actions), we see a table of "conventional" routes for "resources" or what we've been calling models on the backend. (Many times a model and resource represent the same data, but not always.) We see the first item in this list is described as "display a list of all <items>". To follow this convention, the url to view a display of all trimesters should look like this:

```
http://localhost:3000/trimesters
```

We refer to everything after `http://localhost:3000` as the "path". We'll use the HTTP verb `GET` when accessing this url. This is the default HTTP verb a browser uses when making a request to the url you enter in the browser's search bar.

Let's visit that route now and see what happens. In a console window, start your Rails server:

```
bin/rails server
```

Now in a browser, visit `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a page with the Rails logo that lists the versions of Rails, Rack and Ruby you're using. If you don't see this page, get some help before moving on.

Now navigate to the url where we plan to display trimesters: `http://localhost:3000/trimesters`

We see a page that says `Routing Error - No route matches [GET] "/trimesters"`. This is what we expect, since we haven't defined the route. Let's do that now!

In `routes.rb`, we map routes to code following this template:

```
http_method "/path", to: "controller#action" 
```

where `http_method` is one of get, post, put, patch or delete, path is as we mentioned above (like `/trimesters`), and "controller#action" is the name of the controller (without `_controller`) and the name of the action or method in that controller.

Looking back at the CRUD verbs and actions table, to follow conventions, our route will be defined like this:

```
get "/trimesters", to: "trimesters#index"

```
So when a GET request is made to `http://localhost:3000/trimesters`, the Rails server receives the request and then executes the code in the `index` method defined in `app/controllers/trimesters_controller.rb`.

Now that we have the route defined, let's test it out. Reload the page at `http://localhost:3000/trimesters`. Now we get a different error -- `unintialized constant TrimestersController`. This means the route is working -- the Rails server tried to map our GET request to the `index` method in `TrimestersController`, but it threw an error because we haven't created `TrimestersController` yet. So let's do that!


### Step 2. Respond to the request with HTML
In the directory `app/controllers/`, create a new file called `trimesters_controller.rb` as per the naming conventions for controllers described in [Rails Guides here](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#controller-naming-convention).

In this file, we'll define the class as per Rails conventions. Note that this is a special kind of Ruby class that inherits from a class called `ApplicationController`, which is part of the Rails framework.

We'll also define the `index` method Rails expects for the `/trimesters` route.

```
class TrimestersController < ApplicationController

  def index

  end

end
```

Okay, now that we've defined the controller and action Rails expects for the trimesters route, let's reload the page at `http://localhost:3000/trimesters` and see what happens now.

You should see an error message that contains `TrimestersController#index is missing a template for this request format and variant.`. The mention of a "missing template" is Rails indicating that it looked for a template or view to use to respond to this request, but it couldn't find one that matched according to Rails conventions.

By convention, for each controller, we have a directory in `/app/views/` that contains a view template for each controller in the action. Rails will attempt to render the view named the same as the action. So in `/app/views/` let's create a directory called `/trimesters` and in it, a file called `index.html`. For now, just add any valid html to that file. (Maybe add a header with text "Trimesters".)

Now reload `http://localhost:3000/trimesters`. Do you see your html? Now we're getting somewhere! :)

### Step 3. Collect the data to display and add it to the response
Now let's update our HTML to display a list of trimesters. To start, let's just display the term and year of each trimester. If we were coding a static web page with this data, it might look something like this:

```
<h1>Trimesters</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Fall 2024</li>
  <li>Spring 2025</li>
  <li>Summer 2025</li>
  <li>Fall 2025</li>
<ul>
```

This is similar to tasks in earlier lessons when we needed to format trimester data to match a template. In this case, our template is `<li>term year</li>` where we replace term and year with the trimester's term and year. We know how to do this in ruby with a loop. String interpolation in Ruby is similar to Javascript, but with a `#` instead of `$`:

```
Trimester.all.each do |trimester|
  "#{trimester.term} #{trimester.year}"
end
```

We can do something similar in our view. First, we need to change the file extension from `.html` to  `.html.erb`, so rename the view file to `index.html.erb`. This transforms our view into an ERB template, which allows us to write ruby code in the view, which is then executed and added to the HTML before the server sends the HTML back with the response to the web request. Review the [ERB section](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html#templates) of the Rails Guides for a quick introduction.

Mostly what you should know about an ERB template is that it's an HTML file, but you can also add ruby code by wrapping the ruby with a combination of angle brackets and percent signs, with or without an equals as follows: 

```
<% Your ruby code here %>
```
 or
```
<%= Your ruby code that returns HTML here %>`
```

So in our `index.html.erb` file, if we had a list of trimesters we could update our code as follows to get a display similar to what we designed above:

```
<h1>Trimesters</h1>
<ul>
  <% Trimester.all.each do |trimester| %>
   <li><%= "#{trimester.term} #{trimester.year}" %></li>
  <% end %>
<ul>
```

Now reload `http://localhost:3000/trimesters`. Do you see data?? :) 

Look back at the ruby code and the HTML we had before and be sure you understand how we arrived at the ERB code above.

We're not quite done yet, though. It's a better practice to collect data from the database in the controller rather than in the view. Then we populate an instance variable in the controller that is made available to the view by Rails. Let's make that adjustment now.

In the index method in trimesters controller, create an instance variable called `@trimesters` and set it equal to all `Trimester` records:

```
class TrimestersController < ApplicationController

  def index
    @trimesters = Trimester.all
  end

end
```

Because of the special relationship between a Rails controller and action and the view, instance variables set in the action are accessible in the view. Read section [10.2 of the Getting Started](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#instance-variables) section of Rails Guides on the role of instance variables in a controller. So we can replace `Trimester.all` with `@trimesters` in our view:

```
<h1>Trimesters</h1>
<ul>
  <% @trimesters.each do |trimester| %>
   <li><%= "#{trimester.term} #{trimester.year}" %></li>
  <% end %>
<ul>
```

Reload `http://localhost:3000/trimesters` to make sure this works properly. We always want to test our code manually as soon as possible after every change. If we make a bunch of changes and then try to load the page, if we have errors, it will be harder to find what went wrong.

We can ask the `rails` executable to list the routes it knows about, so we can test that we've set up the routes correctly by running the following in a command line:

```
bin/rails routes
```

Refer to [this section](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#listing-existing-routes) of the guides on the output of `rails routes`. Each route has up to four items listed. For now, let's focus on the HTTP verb, the URL pattern to match and the routing parameters.


### The "show" route
Let's add one more trimesters route. You'll see in the table on the Rails Guides above, that another standard or `resourceful` route is the `show` route for a resource. This is the route or page that displays one specific instance of a resource, like one Trimester or one Mentor. See in the table that this route is conventionally defined as a `GET` route with a path like `/trimesters/:id` (where `:id` would be replaced with the id of the trimester we're viewing).

Let's review our steps for implementing a route:
1. Define the route (url + HTTP method) that will display the data when the user visits it, and map the route to a code that will be executed when the request is received.
2. Respond to the request (at the route from step 1) with HTML
3. Collect the data we want to display and include that in our HTML reponse

We'll follow Rails conventions on the route method, name and controller and action mapping. Let's put those pieces in place.

- Add the route definition: In `routes.rb`, add the line `get "/trimesters/:id", to: "trimesters#show"`
- Add the controller action: In `trimesters_controller.rb`, add a method called `show` 

```
def show
end
```

Let's check the output of `bin/rails routes` for our new route:

```
bin/rails routes
```
You should see this line in the output:

```
GET    /trimesters/:id(.:format)                         trimesters#show
```

Now add a view for Rails to render for this route. To follow Rails conventions, we want the view to be named the same as the action, `show`, and should be in the /trimesters directory in /views

## Testing routes with Rspec
We just created a new route in our application. So when a GET request is made to our Rails server at the route `/trimesters` (`http://localhost:3000/trimesters` if we're running the application locally), the Rails server passes the request object to the `index` method in `trimesters_controller.rb`, then responds to the request with the html output from `/views/trimesters/index.html.erb` (after running the ruby code there). To test a route, we want to test the contents of the response when we make a request to the route. The Rspec framework offers Request specs for this purpose. 

Open the file at `spec/requests/trimesters_spec.rb`:

```
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe "Trimesters", type: :request do
  describe "GET /trimesters" do
    context 'trimesters exist' do
      before do
        (1..2).each do |i|
          Trimester.create!(
            term: "Term #{i}",
            year: '2025',
            start_date: '2025-01-01',
            end_date: '2025-01-01',
            application_deadline: '2025-01-01',
          )
        end
      end

      it 'returns a page containing names of all trimesters' do
        get '/trimesters'
        expect(response.body).to include('Term 1 2025')
        expect(response.body).to include('Term 2 2025')
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Note the `type: :request` attribute in the main describe block. This allows us to use the `get` method in the `it` block to make a test request. It also gives us access to the response to the test request via the variable `response`. The HTML output is included in `response.body`, so we can check that output to ensure that we'll see what we expect when we visit `http://localhost:3000/trimesters`.

**Run the test**

In a terminal window,

```
bundle exec rspec spec/requests/trimesters_spec.rb
```

Recall here, that we're prefixing with `bundle exec`, to ensure we're using the gems included in our Gemfile, then we're calling the `rspec` executable and passing the spec file.

You'll see that the output looks similar to our model tests from earlier lessons. There aren't many input scenarios, but we can test what happens when we have no trimesters set up. To set up that scenario, we'll create another context and ensure that we don't create any Trimesters in the before block.

Add a new context (at the same level as the existing context) and title it `trimesters do not exist`. Then update the expectations...we expect the page to have the title `Trimesters`, and we expect it to not have no `<li>` tags. Change `.to` to `.not_to`.

Run the test and ensure it passes.
