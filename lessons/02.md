## Creating and updating data with ActiveRecord

### Task 2: Add courses, enrollments and mentor assignments for an upcoming trimester

In the last lesson, we collected data from our dataset to do various tasks. Now, it's time to set up courses, enrollments and mentor assignments for the next trimester. So we'll learn how to create and update data in Rails using ActiveRecord. Along the way, we'll gain more knowledge and experience with Ruby and object oriented programming. 

### Ruby classes, models & objects
Watch this video that gives an introduction to classes and objects in object oriented languages.

https://youtu.be/kHNhm4UL0Sg?si=hM6X9S_UpEg9Mo6h

Let's map the concepts in the video to what we've seen so far.

Our `Trimester` class is analogous to the `Dog` class in the video, and "Fall 2024" or "Spring 2025" would be analgous to the Jack Russell and German Shepard instances or objects. That is, we would reference them in code as instances of `Trimester`.

We mentioned previously that an ActiveRecord (AR) model is a special type of Ruby class. Each AR model corresponds to a database table, and each row in that table can be retrieved as an instance of the model. And for each column of the database table (remember, these are also the columns on our spreadsheet tabs) we have an attribute on the AR model. Similar to an object in Javascript, attributes of an instance are accessible using the dot operator.

Open the rails console and run the following:

```
spring2025 = Trimester.find_by(year: '2025', term: 'Spring')
```

Here we're creating a variable `spring2025` and setting it equal to an instance of `Trimester`. Let's access some attributes:

```
spring2025.year
spring2025.term
spring2025.application_deadline
```

On your own, for practice. Do the same exercise for the Fall 2024 trimester.
1. Create a variable and set it equal to an instance of `Trimester` with term and year Fall and 2024.
2. Access some attributes on that instance with the dot operator.

### Model.create (a model class method)
So far, we've only been reading data from our database. Let's use ActiveRecord to create a new trimester.

In a rails console, type the following and hit enter:

```
Trimester.create(year: '2026', term: 'Spring', application_deadline: '2026-02-15', start_date: "2026-03-01", end_date: "2026-06-30")
```
Let's take a look at the output:

```
doc-rails(dev)> Trimester.create(year: '2026', term: 'Spring', application_deadline: '2026-02-15')
  TRANSACTION (0.1ms)  BEGIN immediate TRANSACTION /*application='DocRails'*/
  Trimester Create (3.1ms)  INSERT INTO "trimesters" ("year", "term", "application_deadline", "start_date", "end_date", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2025-01-09 04:29:04.718650', '2025-01-09 04:29:04.718650') RETURNING "id" /*application='DocRails'*/
  TRANSACTION (0.1ms)  COMMIT TRANSACTION /*application='DocRails'*/
=>
#<Trimester:0x000000012ddd2948
 id: 10,
 year: '2026',
 term: 'Spring',
 application_deadline: "2025-01-09",
 start_date: "2026-03-01",
 end_date: "2026-06-30",
 created_at: "2025-01-09 04:29:04.718650000 +0000",
 updated_at: "2025-01-09 04:29:04.718650000 +0000">
doc-rails(dev)>
```
You'll see the data we specified, but also some data we didn't specify -- `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`. We also see what you might recognize as a SQL statement logged in the output.

You'll finish task 2 in your assignment this week by creating courses for the Spring 2026 trimester.

### model.update (a model instance method)
### Task 3: Change the application deadline on the upcoming trimester to give students more time to apply
Suppose we decide to change the application deadline on the upcoming trimester to give students more time to apply. Let's update the trimester record using ActiveRecord (AR).

Recall from the video that classes have both attributes (including one for each column) and behaviors or methods. (In the video, the Dog class has a `bark` method, for example.) All AR model instances have the ability to update the table row they represent using the method `update`. Similar to `create` and `find_by` (which are methods on the AR class, rather than on an instance), the `update` method takes as a parameter, a hash of attributes. We pass the attribute names (as symbols) as keys, and the new data are passed as values.

```
trimester = Trimester.find_by(term: 'Fall', year: '2025')
puts trimester.application_deadline
```
The `trimester` instance is an in-memory copy of the data in the row of the database table for that trimester (or you can think about the row in the trimester spreadsheet). We can alter the values of `trimester`, but they won't be changed in the database until we call a method that persists or saves the changes. There are a couple ways to do that:

1. We can change the values on `trimester` and then call `.save!`.
```
trimester.application_deadline = '2025-08-25'
trimester.save!
```

2. We can call the `.update!` method and pass a hash of attributes to update (similar to the `create` and `find_by` methods).
```
trimester.update(application_deadline: '2025-08-25')
```

### Task 4: Add a new mentor and offload some assignments for an overloaded mentor
- A new volunteer, Frank Smith, has signed up to be a mentor. His email is frank.smith@test.com.
  - Create a new `Mentor` record with `Mentor.create`. Pass as a parameter, a hash with the keys `first_name`, `last_name` and `email`, and the corresponding values mentioned above.
- The mentor with id 22 has asked to have their load reduced.
  - We'll assign one of that mentor's students to Frank.

**Challenge yourself!**

See how far you can get with this task on your own! If you need help, you can refer to the walkthrough here. 

**Create a new mentor record**

Last week, we learned that because `Mentor` is an ActiveRecord model, it has a method called `create` which takes a hash of attributes and values. Attribute names map to column names on the `mentors` table.

In a rails console...

```
Mentor.create(first_name: 'Frank', last_name: 'Smith', email: 'frank.smith@test.com')
```

**Ruby hash versus Javascript object literal**

We mentioned that a Ruby hash is similar to a Javascript object literal. In Javascript, an object literal would look like...

```
{
   "first_name": "Frank",
   "last_name": "Smith",
   "email": "frank.smith@test.com"
}
```

This is actually valid Ruby code as well! So our code above could also look like:

```
Mentor.create({ "first_name": "Frank", "last_name": "Smith", "email": "frank.smith@test.com" })
```

But there are a few other ways this can be written in Ruby, due to the following:

- Ruby hash keys may be symbols or strings
- When passing a hash as a parameter to a method, the curly braces may be optional, and often they are omitted
- Just as in Javascript, strings may be denoted using double quotes or single quotes

It's common in Ruby to prefer the least amount of syntax that is still readable and valid. So the first style presented is more common to see.

**Get mentor assignments for mentor 22**

Let's find the `MentorEnrollmentAssignment` records for the mentor with id 22, and choose one to reassign to Frank.

First, get the mentors current assignments. We'll assign them to a variable...
```
mentor_assignments = MentorEnrollmentAssignment.where(mentor_id: 22)
```

Now, let's choose the last one to update. We'll assign it to a new variable, and we'll use the `.last` method. This is a convenience method on an [ActiveRecord::Relation](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.0.1/classes/ActiveRecord/Relation.html). 
```
assignment_to_update = mentor_assignments.last
```

Notice that sometimes ActiveRecord query or finder methods return just one record, and sometimes they return a collection of records (as above). Review the ["Retrieving Objects from the Database"](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#retrieving-objects-from-the-database) section of Rails Guides for more on which methods return a single instance and which return an `ActiveRecord::Relation` (a collection).

**Update a mentor assignment**

Now let's reassign the enrollment to Frank. First, get the id for Frank's mentor record:

```
Mentor.find_by(email: 'frank.smith@test.com')
```

Then update the mentor assignment record we retrieved above with Frank's mentor id. We'll use the ActiveRecord model method `update!`. (Review the [ActiveRecord - Update section](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html#update) of Rails Guides here.) The exclamation point at the end ensures that if the update fails, we get an exception or error detailing the failure. We can also call `update` without the exclamation point -- this is the same method, but if the update fails, no error is thrown. We say it "fails silently". 

Be sure to replace the text in brackets with the actual ID you found for Frank's mentor record.
```
assignment_to_update.update!(mentor_id: <frank's id from above>)
```

Great! Now Frank can help out!

### More practice with relationships
Understanding and identifying the relationships between data is an essential skill for backend and Rails development. The entire application depends heavily on the data model, so it pays to plan carefully and make sure your data model design can handle the different types of scenarios you might encounter. Let's talk more about the different types of relationships. 

### belongs_to and has_many
Looking at the in the belongs_to section of the [Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#belongs-to)

![belongs_to](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Code-the-Dream-School/ruby-rails-v3/refs/heads/main/learns-app-content/lessons/assets/lesson_02/belongs_to.png)

If we had models Book and Author, it makes sense that a Book would "belong to" an Author. Some data in our tables might look like this:

**authors**
| id | last_name | first_name | birth_year |
|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| 755 | Angelou | Maya | 1928 |
| 756 | Twain | Mark | 1835 |
| 757 | Steinbeck | John | 1902 |

**books**
| id | title | author_id | publication_year |
|:-----|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| 1822 | The Grapes of Wrath | 757 | 1939 |
| 1823 | The Adventures of Tom Sawyer | 756 | 1876 |
| 1824 | I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings | 755 | 1969 |

Each book record "belongs to" an author...as indicated by the `author_id` column on the `books` table. Any time a model "belongs to" another model, we can expect to see an id for the "parent" model on the "child" model's table.

We can also say that an author "has many" books. This relationship is indicated by the potentially numerous appearances of an author's id in the `books` table.

**Let's look at some other examples:**
1. `cities` and `states` 
   - A `city` "belongs to" a `state`. A `state` "has many" `cities`.
2. `doctors` and `patients`
   - A `patient` "belongs to" a `doctor`. A `doctor` "has many" `patients`.

### many-to-many (has_many, through: ) (association table required)
Consider the last example -- `doctors` and `patients`. Suppose we're designing a data model for a medical complex with many types of doctors. So a patient may actually have multiple doctors. Maybe the patient has visited a dermatologist, a primary care doctor and a general surgeon. So then our patient has many doctors, but still, every doctor has many patients. In this situation, we might be tempted to store all of the doctor ids on the patient somehow...

| id | name | doctor_1_id | doctor_2_id | doctor_3_id |
|:-----|:--------|:--------|:-----|:--------|
| 389 | Will Smith | 348 | 998 | 223 |

But then what happens when Will needs to see yet another doctor? No matter how many columns we add, some patient will eventually need to see one more doctor than that. Also, it makes searching for a doctor's patients difficult because we have to look in muliple columns. So another thought is to store the ids in an array on the patient record

| id | name | doctor_ids |
|:-----|:--------|:--------|
| 389 | Will Smith | [348, 998, 223] |

This solution might technically work, but it's not the solution that most closely follows Rails conventions. The ideal solution in this case is to use an association table (or a "join" table). This is a model and table whose job is just to store the relationship between two other models.


**patients**
| id | name |
|:-----|:--------|
| 389 | Will Smith |


**doctors**
| id | name | specialty |
|:-----|:--------|:------|
| 149 | Dr. Sue Jones | Dermatology |
| 210 | Dr. Tamara Williams | Primary Care |


**patient_doctor_relationship**
| id | patient_id | doctor_id |
|:-----|:--------|:--------|
| 1299 | 389 | 149 |
| 1300 | 389 | 210 |

With the data structured this way, we only have to look in one column when looking either for all of a doctor's patients, or for all of a patient's doctors. And it's easy to join on another table with the results.

For this structure, we say a `patient` "has many" `doctors` "through" `patient_doctor_relationships`. And a `doctor` "has many" `patients` "through" `patient_doctor_relationships`.

## Associations in the Dream of Code data model (so far)
Below is a diagram of all our application's models (or tables) and their assocations (or relationships).

![ERD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Code-the-Dream-School/ruby-rails-v3/refs/heads/main/learns-app-content/lessons/assets/lesson_02/doc_erd.png)

 We've discussed that a course is a specific instance of a coding class in a certain trimester. You see that `courses` has both `coding_class_id` and `trimesters_id`. So we can say...
- A `course` "belongs to" a `trimester`
- A `course` belongs to a `coding_class`
- A `trimester` "has many" `courses`
- A `coding_class` "has many" `courses`

What can you say about the associations `enrollments` have?

One thing to note is the `mentor_enrollment_assignments`. This is the table that associates mentors with students in a class. Why not associate a mentor with a student record? Consider this scenario:

- Sam Student is enrolled in both React and NodeJS in Fall 2024
- Minnie Mentor is Sam's mentor for the React class
- Mario Mentor is Sam's mentor for the NodeJS class

Also...
- Sam is taking Python in Spring 2025
- Sam's Python mentor is neither Minnie nor Mario

So the association between mentors and students is specific to the `enrollment`. Since an `enrollment` "belongs to" a `student`, we can create an association between the mentor and the enrollment in `mentor_enrollment_assignments`, and then a `mentor` "has many" `students` "through" `mentor_enrollment_assignments`. (And similarly, a `student` "has many" `mentors` "through" `mentor_enrollment_assignments`.)

### Here are a few tips when designing your data model:
1. Start with actual data, then look for the patterns and extrapolate.
2. "Test your design" with other types of example data.
   - For every pair of models, A and B, for example, ask if there's any scenario in which model A would be associated with more than one model B and vice versa.

Review the section on [Choosing an Association in the Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#choosing-an-association). The Guides mention other associations we haven't discussed, which may be convenient for your data model design for your own project, however, they will mostly use the same data design we've discussed, just with different descriptors in code. We'll discuss how associations can make retrieving relevant data in code easier soon.
