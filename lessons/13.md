## Designing an API

Dream of Code App requirements
1. We'd like a dashboard that lists the courses for the current and upcoming trimester. :checkmark:
2. Each of those courses should link to a page that shows the list of enrolled students (for current courses). :checkmark:
3. On the dashboard, there should be a link to a form for adding a new course. :checkmark:
4. On each course page, there should be a link to a form to enroll a student in the course. :checkmark:
5. We need to be able to update the application deadline for the upcoming trimester. :checkmark:
6. Only Dream of Code staff should be able to view student enrollments, create courses and update trimesters. Only students should be able to create assignment submissions. Only mentors should be able to update assignment submissions.
7. We need API endpoints to integrate with external apps. :checkmark:
  a. We need an endpoint that returns current course data.
  b. We need an endpoint that returns student enrollment data in a specific format (per course).

This week we'll implement #7 from our request list.

Dream of Code has an external service they've purchased to manage student engagement. This system analyzes student progress data in order to make suggestions about course curriculum and to notify mentors of students needing attention. The system will pull data from our application on a daily basis, and it expects data to be in a specific format.

Here are the endpoints the system will poll daily:

- Current courses
  - This should be an API endpoint that returns a list of current courses (courses in the current trimester) with the data outlined below

- Course enrollment data
  - This should be an API endpoint that returns a list of students in a course and all info about their assignment submissions for the course

Instead of wireframes, we've been given the expected data shape in the form of sample data. Here's what the system expects for each endpoint:

GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/courses (with header: `Content-Type: application/json`)
```ruby
{
  "courses": [
     {
        "id": 55,
        "title": "Intro to Programming",
        "application_deadline": "2025-01-15",
        "start_date": "2025-01-15",
        "end_date": "2025-01-15"
     },
     {
        "id": 61,
        "title": "Ruby on Rails",
        "application_deadline": "2025-01-15",
        "start_date": "2025-01-15",
        "end_date": "2025-01-15"
     },
     ...etc
  ]
}

```

GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/courses/:id/enrollments (with header: `Content-Type: application/json`)
```ruby
{
  "enrollments": [
    {
      "id": 278,
      "studentId": 68,
      "studentFirstName": "Bob",
      "studentLastName": "Burger",
      "finalGrade": ""
    },
    {
      "id": 302,
      "studentId": 89,
      "studentFirstName": "Marge",
      "studentLastName": "Simpson",
      "finalGrade": ""
    },
    ...etc
  ]

}

```

### Get courses

Let's revisit the steps we followed before to create routes:
1. Define the route, and map the route to a controller and action
2. Respond to the request with static data
3. Collect the data we want to display and return as json in the desired format

Let's start with the current courses endpoint. It's conventional to prefix api-only routes with both `api` and the API version, `v1` in our case. API's are versioned because they should be a reliable interface for consumers. So any major changes to the API (especially any changes that remove things or change the shape of the data returned, etc) should be introduced in a new version so that we don't break the applications of consumers who built their apps to work with the old version.

**1. Define the route**

In Rails, we can accomplish these path prefixes with namespaces in the routes. See [2.6 of the Routing section](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#controller-namespaces-and-routing) of Rails Guides.


```ruby
  namespace :api do
    namespace :v1 do
      get '/courses', to: 'courses#index'
    end
  end
```

Namespaces in routes map to subdirectories in the controller directory. The route `GET /api/v1/courses` maps to the controller `app/controllers/api/v1/courses_controller.rb` and the `index` action. So let's create that controller file and action.

`app/controllers/api/v1/courses_controller.rb`

```ruby
class Api::V1::CoursesController < ApplicationController

  def index
  end

end
```

Now let's test our route manually. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) is a great tool for making http requests. Download Postman -- you may also have to create an account. Once you have the Postman app running locally, with the Collections tab highlighted on the left, click the "New" button and select "HTTP" to create a new request definition.

![postman screenshot](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/ruby-rails-v3/blob/3400fa673f425f942afd12964edd0eb90274b02b/lessons/assets/lesson_13/postman-1.png?raw=true)

In the url field, enter the route for our new api endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/courses`. The default http verb is `GET`, so you can leave it set to that. Click send. In the bottom section of the app, you should see info about the response. We should get a response status `204 No Content` and no data.

**2. Respond with static data**

We want to respond to the request with JSON. We can pass a Ruby hash assigned to the `json` parameter of Rails' `render` method, and Rails will conveniently create valid JSON in the shape of the Ruby hash. 

```ruby
  def index
    courses_hash = {
      courses: [
        {
          id: 55,
          title: "Intro to Programming",
          application_deadline: "2025-01-15",
          start_date: "2025-01-15",
          end_date: "2025-01-15"
        },
        {
          id: 61,
          title: "Ruby on Rails",
          application_deadline: "2025-01-15",
          start_date: "2025-01-15",
          end_date: "2025-01-15"
        }
      ]
    }

    render json: courses_hash, status: :ok
  end
```

Try submitting the request in Postman again. You should see our static data response.

**3. Collect and return dynamic data**

The next bit is familiar to us. We only need to collect the data to return and format it as it is in the static data.

Follow these steps to replace the static data with live data:
1. Get the list of courses in the current trimester.
2. Loop through the list of courses and create a hash in the shape above.
3. In the loop, add each hash to an array. 
4. Assign the array to the `courses` key of the hash to be passed to the render method (`courses_hash`)

You can use Postman to help check your work. When you think you have the correct solution, remove the `skip: true` attribute from `spec/requests/api/v1/courses_controller_spec.rb` and run the spec to verify.

### Get enrollments

**1. Define the route**

Similarly for enrollments, we'll prefix the route with `/api/v1`. We'll also nest the route under courses.

```ruby
namespace :api do
  namespace :v1 do
    get '/courses', to: 'courses#index'
    get '/courses/:course_id/enrollments', to: 'enrollments#index'
  end
end
```

Let's create the enrollments controller `app/controllers/api/v1/enrollments_controller.rb`.

This one is all up to you! See this week's assignment for guidance.
