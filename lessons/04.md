| Lesson objectives                            | Course objectives                        |
|:---------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| Design and implement a data model for your project application | Design and implement a data model for a simple Rails app               |

Congrats on your progress in the course so far! This is an exciting week, as you'll use what you've learned about associations and data modeling to design a schema and create tables and models for your own project!

### TODO -- it may make sense to do this and data model design one week, then come back to migrations, etc after feedback...maybe two weeks later
