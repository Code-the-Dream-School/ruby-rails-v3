Dream of Code App requirements
1. We'd like a dashboard that lists the courses for the current and upcoming trimester. :checkmark:
2. Each of those courses should link to a page that shows the list of enrolled students (for current courses). :checkmark:
3. On the dashboard, there should be a link to a form for adding a new course. :checkmark:
4. On each course page, there should be a link to a form to enroll a student in the course. :checkmark:
5. We need to be able to update the application deadline for the upcoming trimester. :checkmark:
6. Only Dream of Code staff should be able to view student enrollments, create courses and update trimesters.
7. Only students may submit assignments. Only mentors may edit them. A student may see their own info, but other students should not be able to. (There are a list of 'authorization' rules like this.)
8. We need an API endpoint that lists the students enrolled for a course.

This week we'll implement #6 on our request list.

Most web apps require user accounts and login, so it's a very common problem. The Devise gem is a popular library that offers lots of common functionality you would want when adding user accounts and authentication to an app. Furthermore, because it's so popular, we can depend on it to be relatively secure. The more widely used a gem or library is, typically, the more quickly vulnerabilities are discovered and patched.

TODO Devise setup w/ Getting started instructions & youtube TBD
-- add role to users with default 'student'
