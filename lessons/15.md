## Final Project Completion

This week you will complete your final project and make a short presentation recording demonstrating your work.  If there are any additional features you want to add to your project, take a little time to finish those this week.  Use debugging tools and documentation to make sure your final project is complete and working well.  When all your work is done (or at least that you've met rubric requirements and have a working product) merge open pull requests and submit your final project.  Be sure to make your demo and submit that as well.  Details on the demo are as follows:

## Project Demo Details

It is good practice to talk about what you have learned and know about project as you will be asked to talk about your experiences in job interviews. This is why we ask all students to give a short demo of their final projects. This **demo is NOT graded and your performance in the demo will have no bearing on your graduation**. Please record a 3-5 minute presentation that touches on all of the following:

 - [ ] Provide a quick overview of the app
 - [ ] Demonstrate your app's CRUD functionality
	 - [ ] Show your app in the browser
		 - [ ] Show logging in and/or user creation (if applicable) 
	 - [ ] Create a piece of data
  - [ ] Show how data is Read
  - [ ] Update a piece of data
  - [ ] Delete a piece of data
	 - [ ] Show any additional features of the app such as pagination, search functionality, or any gems you may have included
 - [ ] Share what the most challenging part of the project and what you enjoyed working on the most or answer any of the following questions:
   - [ ] Did you encounter any problems? How did you resolve them? What resources did you use?
   - [ ] What did you have the most fun building?
   - [ ] Did you reach your end goal?
   - [ ] How would you want to continue your project and grow it further? 

## How to Record Your Presentation

You can record your presentation in any of these three ways:
 1. Logging into your personal Zoom account and record your personal meeting where only you are in attendance and you are screen-sharing your work ([this is a link to a video on how to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njwbjFYCbGU))
 2. Use a screen recording program already on your machine
	- [Mac users can use this link to watch a how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Byefp51tY)
	- [Windows users can use this link to watch a how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJB7pM5bvNI)
 3. Use an online option such as loom ([link to a how to video on loom here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAdLPbfXcQo)).
