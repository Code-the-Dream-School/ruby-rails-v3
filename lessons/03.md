| Learn to modify a Rails schema to add new tables | Design and implement a data model for a simple Rails app |

### Adding new tables and models
Currently, Dream of Code mentors keep track of student grades on their own throughout the course, and then just assign a final grade on the student's enrollment record at the end of the course. This has been problematic at times when mentors have lost student data or have left in the middle of a course due to emergencies. Also, Dream of Code staff may not know if a mentor is falling behind on grading during a course. So we need to add the ability to manage course assignment submissions and mentor submission reviews in our application.

This is a new type of data, so we'll need some new tables.

Consider these requirements:
- Every course has a set of lessons
- A student should be able to submit an assignment for every lesson in their course
- A mentor should be able to review and assign a grade or result for the review
- DoC staff need to know when assignments have been submitted and reviewed

So an assignment submission needs to store the following data:
- the student who submitted it
- the time the student submitted the assignment
- the lesson the assignment is for
- the review result from a mentor's review
- the mentor who reviewed it
- the time the mentor reviewed

So this new table and model will be related to three existing tables/models: `Student`, `Lesson`, and `Mentor`.

- Discuss starting with example data and extrapolating

TODO:
More instruction and examples of relationships. Add some assignment questions on relationships:
- Suppose Dream of Code starting a summer code camp for kids. Students need a login, and parents also do. How would you set up the relationship and tables
- Now suppose students have multiple guardians who need to login and view the student's work.
- Does your model account for families with multiple children? How does it change now?
