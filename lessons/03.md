### Adding new tables and models
####Feature request 1: Allow student assignment submissions to be managed in the application

Until now, Dream of Code mentors keep track of student grades on their own throughout the course, and then just assign a final grade on the student's enrollment record at the end of the course. This has been problematic at times when mentors have lost student data or have left in the middle of a course due to emergencies.

So we need to add the ability to manage student assignment submissions and mentor reviews in our application. This means we'll need to store a new type of data, so we'll need some new tables.

Consider these requirements:
- A student should be able to submit an assignment for every lesson in their course
- A mentor should be able to review and assign a grade or result for the review
- DoC staff need to see the date an assignment was submitted and the date it was reviewed

So an assignment submission needs to store the following data:
- the student and course (`Enrollment`) the submission is for
- the time the student submitted the assignment
- the `Lesson` the assignment is for
- the `Mentor` who reviewed it
- the review result from a mentor's review
- the time the mentor reviewed

So this new table and model will be related to three existing tables/models: `Enrollment`, `Lesson`, and `Mentor`.

### Extra: TODO Introduction to SQL
- download the GUI
- copy the commands from the terminal into SQL, but update some things
- reference cheat sheet, tables, models, files, attributes, columns,
