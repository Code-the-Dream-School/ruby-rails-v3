## Controllers and routing - Non-resourceful routes, Multiple model requests, Query params, JSON requests

### Dream of Code app requirements list
Our Dream of Code colleagues are happy to see the list of trimesters and mentors displayed in the app, and now they've given us a list of requirements for the app. In order of priority, here they are:

1. We'd like a dashboard that lists the courses for the current and upcoming trimester.
2. Each of those courses should link to a page that shows the list of enrolled students (for current courses).
3. On the dashboard, there should be a link to a form for adding a new course.
4. On each course page, there should be a link to a form to enroll a student in the course.
5. We need to be able to update the application deadline for the upcoming trimester.
6. Only Dream of Code staff should be able to view student enrollments, create courses and update trimesters.
7. We need API endpoints to integrate with external apps. 
  a. We need an endpoint that returns current course data.
  b. We need an endpoint that returns student enrollment data in a specific format (per course).

We'll implement the first two this week.

### Dashboard of courses
We can reuse some of our code from the last lesson to build the dashboard. Here's a wireframe of what we'd like the dashboard to look like.

![admin-dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Code-the-Dream-School/ruby-rails-v3/refs/heads/main/learns-app-content/lessons/assets/lesson_07/admin-dashboard.png)

So we need some, but not all trimester data. And we need data from courses, but remember that the name of a course is stored in the coding class associated, since a course is a specific instance of a coding class. Let's follow the same steps we took in the last lesson:

1. Define the route, and map the route to a controller and action
2. Respond to the request with HTML (an outline with static data at first)
3. Collect the data we want to display and include that in our HTML reponse

For the route we need to decide:
1. HTTP Method
  - We're reading data (not creating, updating or deleting), so we should use the GET method or verb.
2. Path
  - Since this route does not fit the format of one of a "resourceful route", we can choose the path to just be something that makes sense, like `/dashboard`. There's no Rails convention to follow for that part.
3. Controller and action
  - Again, since our route is not a resource route, we don't have a prescription from Rails. Let's make a new controller called `admin_dashboard_controller.rb` and add an action called `index`. Though Rails wouldn't mandate the action name, `index` is the standard "starting route" for a directory in the context of web development, in general. So it makes sense as an action name of r our dashboard controller. As we add more routes, we might decide to change how the controllers, actions and views are structured or named. No need to worry about making the perfect choice the first time.

Now you have enough information to add the route to the `/config/routes.rb` file, so do that now.

Before we go any further, let's set up a request spec for our route. Add the spec file at `/spec/requests/admin_dashboard_spec.rb` with the spec stub:

```
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe 'Dashboard', type: :request do
  describe 'GET /dashboard' do
    it 'returns a 200 OK status' do
      get "/dashboard"

      expect(response).to have_http_status(:ok)
    end
  end
end
```

Now run the spec -- it should fail since we haven't set up a controller and action yet. Add the controller and action (see above). Then add a view at `/app/views/admin_dashboard/index.html.erb`. Remember that Rails will look for a view to render using the controller and action name, so it's important to follow the naming conventions when adding view files.

Run the spec -- it should pass now.

### Outlining test cases and practicing TDD

Instead of reloading the browser after every step, we can write test cases for what we should expect to see in our view and 
then as we write the code, we'll see our tests pass. This helps us stay on track and be sure we're making progress. Let's outline some test expectations.

So the dashboard view should...
1. Display the current trimester name and term
2. Display the upcoming trimester name and term
3. Should not display any trimesters that are not the current or upcoming trimester
4. Display links to courses in the current trimester
5. Display links to courses in the upcoming trimester

That seems like a good start. Let's stub out those test cases in our spec file:

```
require 'rails_helper'

RSpec.describe 'Dashboard', type: :request do
  describe 'GET /dashboard' do
    it 'returns a 200 OK status' do
      # Send a GET request to the dashboard route
      get "/dashboard"

      # Check that the response status is 200 (OK)
      expect(response).to have_http_status(:ok)
    end

    it 'displays the current trimester' do
    end

    it 'displays links to the courses in the current trimester' do
    end

    it 'displays the upcoming trimester' do
    end

    it 'displays links to the courses in the upcoming trimester' do
    end
  end
end
```

We'll check the contents of the response body, which will contain the HTML. So if our page contains this HTML:

```
<h1>New Page</h1>

<p>Some content here</p>
```

A test for this page might look like:

```
it 'displays the header' do
  get '/new-page'

  expect(response.body).to include('New Page')
end
```

### Display the current trimester
We'll define "current trimester" as follows: if a trimester's `start_date` is prior to or equal to today, and `end_date` is today or after, that trimester is the current trimester. (There are no data constraints that ensure this, but for now, we can assume there will only be one trimester that fits this criteria.)

Set up the test data to include a trimester that fits the criteria of "current trimester" and at least one trimester that does not fit that criteria. Create the test data in an [rspec `before` block](https://rspec.info/features/3-12/rspec-core/hooks/before-and-after-hooks/) just under `describe 'GET /dashboard'`. The `current_trimester` is provided for you here. Use this as a guide to help you define the `past_trimester` variable. What variables do you need to change?

```
 describe 'GET /dashboard' do
   before do
     current_trimester = Trimester.create!(
       term: 'Current term',
       year: Date.today.year.to_s,
       start_date: Date.today - 1.day,
       end_date: Date.today + 2.months,
       application_deadline: Date.today - 16.days
     )
     # Define past_trimester here and uncomment it when you're ready.
     # past_trimester =
   end
```

Now let's define what we expect to see with this data setup. Looking at the wireframe, we'd like for the term and year of current trimester to be displayed with this format "<term name> - <year>", where term name and year match the values of the current trimester. Finish that test below with what you expect, given the values of the current trimester data we set up.

```
 it 'displays the current trimester' do
   get "/dashboard"
   expect(response.body).to include("your string here")
```

Now run the test. It should fail because we haven't written that code yet. Let's do that now.

Recall to the steps we follow when defining a route:
1. Define the route, and map the route to a controller and action :checkmark:
2. Respond to the request with HTML (an outline with static data at first)
3. Collect the data we want to display and include that in our HTML reponse

Let's define the html with static or dummy data. We already know the data we should use to make the test pass, so let's use that.

In the dashboard view, add some html that includes expected string above. Use exactly the string as it's written in your expectation. Recall that everything in this file must be valid HTML, or must be valid "ERB", which Rails evaluates to HTML. Save the file and run the spec. It should pass now. If it doesn't, troubleshoot the issue to determine why the spec isn't passing. (What does the error say? What does it say the expected value is? What is the value of the HTML in the test output? Is it what you expect?)

Now for step 3: Collect the data we want to display and include that in our HTML response.

We gather data for display in the controller action that displays the HTML view. Open `app/controllers/admin_dashboard_controller.rb` and add an `index` method if it doesn't not already exist.

What's the data we want to return here? We need some data about the current trimester. So let's use ActiveRecord to query for the current trimester, and we can set that to an instance variable to pass to the view.

Because we want to query with less than and greater than (rather than equals or not equals), we'll use a different syntax for where, that allows us to define the expression `"start_date > ?"` with `?` as a parameter for the value, and it takes the value of the parameter as the second argument.

Also note here that we're chaining `.where`. This is synonomous with `.where(this condition AND this condition)`. Also note that since a `where` query always returns a collection of records, we'll need to use `.first` to get the first record returned by the query. (There are a few things we'd want to be careful about here in a real-world app. For example, if no records are returned, this code will throw a null reference exception. But we'll ignore that scenario for the moment to focus on the big picture.)

```
  def index
    @current_trimester = Trimester.where("start_date <= ?", Date.today).where("end_date >= ?", Date.today).first
  end
```

Now, in the view, we can replace our string with the values from `term` and `year` of `@current_trimester`.

We'll need to use ruby string interpolation `#{}`, so we'll have to enclose our ruby code in the ERB tag `<%= %>`

```
<h2><%= "#{@current_trimester.term} - #{@current_trimester.year}" %></h2>
```

Now run the test again. If all is set up correctly, it should pass. If it doesn't pass, here are a few troubleshooting questions:

1. Do you have a syntax error in the HTML/ERB?
2. Do you have a null (or nil) reference error? (You might see something like "undefined method `term' for nil")
  - Set a `debugger` statement in your controller to test if your data is set up properly. Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/Fk63VgKPHm8?si=D3KHXdKvRjsuuoHu) on using `debugger`.
3. Look carefully at the output versus the expected output. Is there a typo, case difference or space difference?

Let's see how our view looks when we run the application. In a terminal, start the app:

```
bin/rails s
```

Navigate to the path we defined for the dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`.

### Display the current trimester's course list

Recall from lesson 3, that we can access a model's associated data with the dot operator. A `trimester` `has_many` `courses`, so we can access a trimesters courses like `trimester.courses`.

In the dashboard view, loop through the current trimester's courses, and output a link, title with the class title. (Also recall that a `course` `belongs_to` a `coding_class`, and the course/class title is stored on the `coding_class` record.)

Under the current trimester header, define a loop in ERB tags. (We use `<% %>` instead of `<%= %>` because we do not expect any HTML output from these lines.)
```
<h2><%= "#{@current_trimester.term} - #{@current_trimester.year}" %></h2>
<% @current_trimester.courses.each do |course| %>

<% end %>
```

Now since we have a list of courses to display, let's use an HTML `<ul>` tag and output a `<li>` for each course. Because we only want to create one `<ul>`, we'll surround the loop code with that tag.
```
<h2><%= "#{@current_trimester.term} - #{@current_trimester.year}" %></h2>
<ul>
 <% @current_trimester.courses.each do |course| %>

 <% end %>
</ul>
```

Now, add the `<li>` for each course. We want to include an anchor tag, but we can leave the href blank for now, since we don't have a course page to link to yet.

```
<h2><%= "#{@current_trimester.term} - #{@current_trimester.year}" %></h2>
<ul>
 <% @current_trimester.courses.each do |course| %>
   <li><a href=""><%= course.coding_class.title %></a></li>
 <% end %>
</ul>
```

Now run the app and visit the dashboard page to see how it looks. Stop to troubleshoot if you get any errors.
