## Designing an API (part 2)

Dream of Code App requirements
1. We'd like a dashboard that lists the courses for the current and upcoming trimester. :checkmark:
2. Each of those courses should link to a page that shows the list of enrolled students (for current courses). :checkmark:
3. On the dashboard, there should be a link to a form for adding a new course. :checkmark:
4. On each course page, there should be a link to a form to enroll a student in the course. :checkmark:
5. We need to be able to update the application deadline for the upcoming trimester. :checkmark:
6. Only Dream of Code staff should be able to view student enrollments, create courses and update trimesters. Only students should be able to create assignment submissions. Only mentors should be able to update assignment submissions.
7. We need API endpoints to integrate with external apps. :checkmark:
  a. We need an endpoint that returns current course data.
  b. We need an endpoint that returns student enrollment data in a specific format (per course).
8. We need an API endpoint that allows for the creation of a student record.

Nearly done with our Dream of Code app MVP (minimum viable product)! Let's implement the last request.

### Create a student

Let's start with our usual steps:
1. Define the route, and map the route to a controller and action
2. Respond to the request with static data
3. Collect the data we want to display and return as json in the desired format

** 1. Define the route **

As we know now, since we are creating a new record, we'll use the `POST` verb, and we'll follow the path naming convention for creating a new resource: `POST /api/v1/students`

```
  namespace :api do
    namespace :v1 do
      get '/courses', to: 'courses#index'
      get '/courses/:course_id/enrollments', to: 'enrollments#index'
      post '/students', to: 'students#create'
    end
  end
```

And now for the controller...

`app/controllers/api/v1/students_controller.rb`

```
class Api::V1::StudentsController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

  def create
  end
end
```

We need to include `skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token` to bypass some default security Rails includes for post routes. It's also worth noting that in a production-ready application, the API routes we're creating now would be behind authentication, but that's outside the scope of these lessons.

** 2. Respond with static data **

In a route that creates a new resource, it's typical for the response to include the id and a copy (or partial copy) of the resource created. Let's say that the create student route, when successful, should respond with data like this:

```
{
  "student" : {
    "id": 222,
    "first_name": "Bob",
    "last_name": "Barker,
    "email": "bob@example.com"
  }
}
```

So let's set that up in our controller:
```
class Api::V1::StudentsController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

  def create
    student = {
      id: 123,
      first_name: "Marge",
      last_name: "Simpson",
      email: "marge@simpsons.com"
    }
    render json: { student: student },  status: :created
  end
end
```

Now let's test this in Postman. You'll need to select "POST" from the dropdown next to the url and update the url to point to `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/students`. You should see a successful response and the test data should be returned.

** 3. Return dynamic data **

Now we'll need to create a new student record from the post data in the request. Let's set up our request in Postman first. Under the URL input, click the "Body" tab, then select the "raw" radio button. Here is where we'll input our post data. You can actually copy exactly the test data response and just remove the "id" parameter.

![postman screenshot](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/ruby-rails-v3/refs/heads/main/lessons/assets/lesson_14/postman-2.png?raw=true)

Test the post with the parameters. You should still get the test response.

Recall that we do need to specify which parameters we want to permit when creating a new student. We'll add this `student_params` method that requires a `student` hash and permits the below attributes contained in that hash.

```
class Api::V1::StudentsController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

  def create
  end

  private

  def student_params
    params.require(:student).permit(:first_name, :last_name, :email)
  end
end
```

Now the rest should be familiar. We'll just create a new student from the `student_params` hash, try to save the student, and respond with the errors if we're not successful.

```
  def create
    student = Student.new(student_params)

    if student.save
      student_hash = {
        id: student.id,
        first_name: student.first_name,
        last_name: student.last_name,
        email: student.email
      }
      render json: { student: student_hash },  status: :created
    else
      render json: { errors: student.errors.full_messages }, status: :unprocessable_entity
    end
  end
```

Test with your Postman request. You might quickly encounter the error scenario if you're not updating your test data. Remove the `skip: true` attribute in `spec/requests/api/v1/students_controller_spec.rb` and ensure the spec passes.
