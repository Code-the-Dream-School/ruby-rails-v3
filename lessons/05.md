# Lesson 5
## Ruby methods and testing

| Lesson objectives                            | Course objectives                        |
|:---------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| Implement behavioral methods in a Ruby class to pass a test spec | Implement basic behaviors in Ruby classes | 
| Run and modify Rspec tests  | Write automated unit tests using Rspec |

In the video we watched in lesson 2, we learned that classes have both attributes (dog breeds in the video, table columns in our case) and behaviors. We've discussed some behaviors that ActiveRecord models have in common -- the ability to update themselves, for example. But we will also often want to add behavior to our ActiveModel classes.

### Adding behavior to a Course with Test Driven Development
#### Feature request 2: Simplify collecting email addresses and names for students enrolled in a course

In the first couple of lessons, we collected the email addresses of students in a course in order to send a mass email informing them about upcoming classes. Getting a list of email addresses or names for students in a course are common tasks at the Dream of Code school, so let's write a method to do that work for us.

**Add a method to the Course class that returns a list of student names for enrolled students**

Returning a list of enrolled student names will be a behavior of a `Course`. That is, we'll add a method to `Course` that returns such a list. One of our coworkers has already written the specs (or tests) for this function, so we'll know the function is ready when we run the specs and they all pass. This method of writing the tests first is called Test Driven Development and it can be a helpful way to implement discreet bits of work.

To get a better understanding of test driven development, watch this short video.

Watch this intro to automated testing, the Rails environment and a primer on how to read Rspec test files.


Then code along with this video to use test driven development to implement a method on the `Course` model.
