## Spreadsheet to database
When our fictional code school, Dream of Code, was started, the organizers wanted to be lean in their processes, and therefore decided to use a multi-tabbed spreadsheet to track course offerings, student enrollments, mentor assignments, grades and more. Dream of Code organizers knew they'd want to eventually transfer this data to a database, so they set up the spreadsheet to mirror how they expected the data to be represented in a database.

Open [this spreadsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Code-the-Dream-School/ruby-rails-v3/refs/heads/main/learns-app-content/lessons/assets/lesson_01/doc-data.xlsx) in a spreadsheet program like Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, Numbers (on Mac) or LibreOffice Calc. You should see 7 tabs or sheets of data.

Let's focus first on the sheets titled `coding_classes`, `courses` and `trimesters`:
- A `trimester` is a term in which classes are held. Spring 2025, for example. In addition to a year and term, every trimester has start and end dates, an application deadline, and a unique identifier (id).
- A `coding_class` is a type of class offered, for example, "Intro to Programming", "React", "Ruby on Rails", etc. In addition to a title, a coding class also has a description and a unique identifier (id).
- A `course` is a specific run of a coding class in a trimester. For example, "Ruby on Rails - Spring 2025". This is why in the `course` tab, we see columns titled `coding_class_id` and `trimester_id`. In addition, a course has a maximum enrollment -- the 
max number of students permitted to enroll.

Watch this short video about the data model. 
TODO video that walks through data model ERD, relates to spreadsheet and DoC tasks.

### Task 1: Email students about upcoming courses
Suppose we need to send an email to all current students in the Intro course, encouraging them to enroll in a course for the upcoming trimester. Let's get the data we need: 

To get the list of classes for the upcoming trimester:
1. Let's say the upcoming trimester is Fall 2025. What is the trimester id that corresponds to that trimester? (Get this from the `trimesters` tab.)
2. Looking at the `courses` tab, find the rows where `trimester_id` matches the id from question 1. For each of these rows, use the `coding_class_id` to reference the corresponding coding class on the `coding_classes` tab. 
3. For each row from question 2, fill in this template, replacing everything in angle brackets (<>) with the data you found above.

```
<course id>, <coding class name> - <trimester term> <trimester year>
```

## Reading data with ActiveRecord
Maybe you can imagine how managing all of the code school's data with a spreadsheet might become unweildy and error prone. Let's start building a web application to manage Dream of Code's data. Some of our coworkers have already gotten started, so let's clone the repository and get familiar with the app.

### Clone and set up the project
- Follow instructions to get your machine set up with Ruby
- Follow instructions on the Readme for the Dream of Code app repository to set up the app

After you get set up, watch this short video that gives an overview of the environment and some tools we'll be using in this course.
- TODO short video explaining terminal, app, rails commands, rails console, generators, database, database gui

### ActiveRecord
A core library in the Rails framework called ActiveRecord is responsible for the configuration code that allows us to interact with data in the database using Ruby classes. (We'll talk more about Ruby classes in future lessons, but they are similar to Javascript classes or objects.) Let's see how ActiveRecord works.

Each of our tabs from the spreadsheet is now a table in our database, and each is mapped to a Ruby class. Class names in Ruby are singular and Pascal case (a special type of [camel case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Camel_case)), while table names are plural and [snake case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Snake_case). ActiveRecord and Rails depend on this naming convention
to work properly. We'll learn more about this later.

Look in the `app/models/` directory. Each file here is an ActiveRecord model -- a Ruby class that is associated with a table in the database.

In a terminal, start the rails console.

```
bundle exec rails c
```

In the prompt, type `Trimester.last` and hit enter. 

```
  Trimester Load (1.6ms)  SELECT "trimesters".* FROM "trimesters" ORDER BY "trimesters"."id" DESC LIMIT 1 /*application='DocRails'*/
=>
#<Trimester:0x0000000121db9bc0
 id: 9,
 year: "2025",
 term: "Fall",
 application_deadline: "2025-08-15",
 start_date: "2025-09-01",
 end_date: nil,
 created_at: "2025-01-01 19:21:16.044837000 +0000",
 updated_at: "2025-01-01 19:21:16.044837000 +0000">
```

If we look back at our spreadsheet, we'll see that this displays the data from the last row in our spreadsheet. Now type `Trimester.first` in the command prompt and hit enter. We'll see that the data displayed here matches the first row in our spreadsheet. Now try `Trimester.all`. This should print all rows from the spreadsheet.

- `Trimester` is a Ruby class that is configured by Rails to map to the database table `trimesters`. 
  - It's a special class that inherits methods and behavior from a Rails library called ActiveRecord. We call these classes ActiveRecord models.
  - Analogously, we have models `CodingClass`, `Course`, `Student`, `Enrollment`, which map to tables named `coding_classes`, `courses`, `students`, `enrollments`, etc.
- The methods `first`, `last` and `all` are ActiveRecord methods called "finder methods". You can find these methods listed in this (section of the Rails Guides)[https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html#read] Let's try some other methods mentioned in that section.
   - You likely learned to use the dot operator to access attributes and call methods in Javascript, so hopefully this syntax is familiar.

Let's find the course record for the Spring 2025 Intro to Programming course. Try this in the rails console prompt:

```
CodingClass.find_by({ title: 'Intro to Programming' })
```

- `CodingClass` is the special Ruby class (model) that maps to the database table `coding_classes`
- `find_by` is a finder method on `CodingClass`
- `{ title: 'Intro to Programming' }` is a Ruby hash, and it's very similar to an object literal in Javascript.
  - A Ruby hash is a collection of key, value pairs. There is one key called `title`, and the corresponding value is a string 'Intro to Programming'. In Javascript, keys are strings, while in Ruby, keys may be strings, but they may also be a Ruby datatype called a symbol. For now, it's enough to know that symbols are frequently used to name keys in a hash but you can read more about symbols [here](https://www.rubyguides.com/2018/02/ruby-symbols/).

Let's continue gathering the data we need for Task 1. We want to get the id of the upcoming trimester, so that we can use that id to find the courses scheduled in that trimester.

```
Trimester.find_by(year: '2025', term: 'Fall')
```
