## Spreadsheet to database
When our fictional code school, Dream of Code, was started, the organizers wanted to be lean in their processes, and therefore decided to use a multi-tabbed spreadsheet to track student enrollments, mentor assignments, student submissions, grades and more. Dream of Code organizers knew they'd want to eventually transfer this data to a database, so they set up the spreadsheet to mirror how they expected the data to be represented in a database.

Take a look at [this spreadsheet](). You may want to download it and view it in your own Google Sheets, Libre Office or Excel. It's not necessary for the assignment, but you might find it easier to answer some of the questions if you're able to add data to the spreadsheet yourself.

## Reading relational data
Let's focus first on the tabs titled `coding_classes`, `courses` and `trimesters`.

- A `trimester` is a term in which classes are held. Spring 2025, for example. In addition to a year and term, every trimester has start and end dates, an application deadline, and a unique identifier (id).
- A `coding_class` is a type of class offered, for example, "Intro to Programming", "React", "Ruby on Rails", etc. In addition to a title, a coding class also has a description and a unique identifier (id).
- A `course` is a specific run of a coding class in a trimester. For example, "Ruby on Rails - Spring 2025". This is why in the `course` tab, we see columns titled `coding_class_id` and `trimester_id`. In addition, a course has a maximum enrollment -- the 
max number of students permitted to enroll.
